* What is sensible.emacs.d?

  =sensible.emacs.d= is a clean room implementation of what a pure vanilla Emacs
  configuration should be for any user, that is sanely manageable, and practically
  useful by everyone.

  It strives to steer away from existing trends or dogmas, avoiding unnecessary packages,
  and among all, stick with the most basic and complete "useful form".
  
  Over time, the configuration will improve, based on what's "realized" design pattern
  that is both beautiful and "makes sense".

* Personable and Sensible Emacs Configuration

  This Emacs configuration aims to be uncluttered, clean, vanilla, and
  practically useful for any day-to-day tasks.

  It only has the absolute necessary configurations, tailored to be minimal,
  practical and useful. It is easy to add any additional feature and package
  later if you need one.

  There are several reasons for keeping the configuration to a bare minimum, one
  is that it's easier to keep track of all the packages and keystrokes. It is
  better to have a setup that you use 90% of the time, than having a cluttered
  setup that will just make it difficult to keep up with gazillions of
  preinstalled packages that usually end-up being unused.

  This configuration tries not to be a one-size-fits all configuration, but it
  tries to be an Emacs configuration that suits most of the developers, and I
  keep it personable, clean, easy and sensible.

** Overrides and personal configurations

   Settings can be overridden by creating the elisp file in the =personal/=
   folder. All configurations on this folder will be loaded right after the
   initialization of the configurations and packages is completed, however,
   appending =pre=, i.e. =pre-<file>.el= on the config file will preload the
   file.

   All overrides and personal configurations in the =personal/*.el= folder is
   added to =.gitignore= file, to avoid committing any personal information in
   VC.

** Default File Locations

   All personal configurations, org-notes, backups and auto-saves are stored in
   the =~/Documents/Emacs/= directory. Those files should not be committed to
   GIT, but they should be managed via your file-sync utility (i.e. iCloud,
   Dropbox, etc.).

   Package configs and variable files are stored in =~/Documents/Emacs/config/=
   and =~/Documents/Emacs/data/= respectively.

   Org workdir are set to =~/Documents/Emacs/org/=.

   However, you can override it by creating a personal config file in the
   =personal/= folder.

   For example, create a file =~/.emacs.d/personal/org.el= which contains the
   following overrides.

   #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
     (setq org-directory "~/Emacs/org")
     (setq org-mobile-directory (expand-file-name "~/Emacs/mobile"))
   #+END_SRC

** Behavior

   On startup, Emacs will present this =README.org= document.

   The default Emacs =pulse.el= is pre-configured to provide visual feedback
   on the current line when switching buffers.

   Buffers are automatically-sized using =zoom= when created.

   Emoji display support is handled via =unicode-fonts= package.

** Window Transparency Mode

   Window transparency can be enabled by defining =transparent-windows-mode=
   variable to =t=.

   For example, if you create a =personal/pre-variables.el= file with the
   content =(setq transparent-windows-mode t)=, this will turn transparency mode
   on.

** Workspaces

   This configuration uses [[https://github.com/nex3/perspective-el][perspective-el]] for managing and switching to
   different workspaces.

   Initially, workspaces are numbered from 0 to 5. The default workspace is 0.

   To switch to a workspace, type =C-M-<0 to 5>=.

   - C-x x ? :: show persp-mode keys
   - C-x x s :: switch or create workspace
   - C-x x n or C-c x p :: next/previous workspaces
   - C-x x c :: delete workspace
   - C-x x r :: rename workspace

** Commenting

   Commenting and uncommenting a line is mapped to =CMD-/= or =S-/=.

** Multiple select and edit

   Here's the key-stroke to use the multiple select and edit feature.

   - C-c C-SPC :: Select and edit leading edges
   - C-c M-SPC :: Select and edit trailing edges

** GTD+Zettelkasten org-mode files
   I created [[https://github.com/jjuliano/practical.org.el][practical.org.el]] GTD+Zettelkasten configuration and presets for
   managing my tasks, notes, routines, habits and agenda. All the org files
   should be put relative to your =org-directory= path. The plugin has
   pre-configured org-files by default which is included in the repository
   under the =files/= folder.

   Please refer to the [[https://github.com/jjuliano/practical.org.el#installation][practical.org.el's installation instructions]].

** Org-mode GTD+Zettelkasten Key Bindings

   Aside from the classic default keys. Here's important key-strokes for using
   the =practical.org.el= presets.

** Further Customizations

   Some packages are easy to include in the configuration, while other packages
   requires post-installation procedures. In those packages, it's recommended to
   use [[https://elpa.gnu.org/][GNU ELPA]] and [[https://melpa.org/][MELPA]].

   The [[Packages][default packages]] includes a custom configuration that contains the basic
   necessary settings to readily use it, you can modify the settings in the
   =~/.emacs.d/config/01-packages.el= file.
