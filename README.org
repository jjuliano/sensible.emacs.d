* My Personal Emacs Configuration

This Emacs configuration only has the absolute necessary configurations tailored
for my needs. If I need additional feature and package, I can add them later.

It's easier to keep track that way, than trying to keep up with gazillions of
pre-installed packages that I don't use.

This configuration tries not to be a one-size-fits all configuration, but it
tries to be an Emacs configuration that suits me, that I keep it personal,
clean, easy and sensible.

** Files

For starters, it includes a =.gitignore=, which ignores all directories, except
the following files and directories:

#+BEGIN_SRC text
├── about-me.el
├── config
│   └── *
├── init.el
├── pkgs
│   └── *
├── README.org
└── themes
    └── *
#+END_SRC

** Packages

It uses the following packages by default, the individual elisp packages are
source directly from the website, while other packages are hosted and are
managed by =git submodules=.

  - [[https://github.com/emacscollective/no-littering][no-littering]] :: ensure .emacs.d folder is clean
  - [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/backup-each-save.el][backup-each-save.el]] :: backup files on each save
  - [[https://git.sr.ht/~technomancy/better-defaults][better-defaults.el]] :: the base defaults
  - [[https://github.com/purcell/exec-path-from-shell][exec-path-from-shell]] :: made $PATH available inside Emacs
  - [[https://github.com/arcticicestudio/nord-emacs][nord-emacs]] :: default theme
  - [[https://github.com/jjuliano/practical.org.el][practical.org.el]] :: practical org-mode GTD and Zekelkasten workflow presets
  - [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/download/multiple-line-edit.el][multiple-line-edit.el]] :: select lines simultaneously
  - [[https://github.com/cyrus-and/zoom][zoom]] :: auto-resize active windows
  - [[https://github.com/nex3/perspective-el][perspective-el]] :: workspaces management

** File Locations

All personal configurations, org-notes, backups and auto-saves are stored in the
=~/Downloads/Emacs/= directory. Those files should not be committed to GIT, but
they should be managed via your file-sync utility (i.e. iCloud, Dropbox, etc.).

Package configs and variable files are stored in =~/Documents/Emacs/config/= and
=~/Documents/Emacs/data/= respectively.

Org workdir are set to =~/Documents/Emacs/org/=.

** Behavior

On startup, Emacs will present this =README.org= document.

The default Emacs =pulse.el= is pre-configured to provide visual feedback
on the current line when switching buffers.

Buffers are automatically-sized using =zoom= when created.

Emoji display support is handled via =unicode-fonts= package.

** Workspaces

This configuration uses [[https://github.com/nex3/perspective-el][perspective-el]] for managing and switching to different
workspaces.

Initially, workspaces are numbered from 0 to 5. The default workspace is 0.

To switch to a workspaces, type =C-M-<0 to 5>=.

- C-x x ? :: show persp-mode keys
- C-x x s :: switch or create workspace
- C-x x n or C-c x p :: next/previous workspaces
- C-x x c :: delete workspace
- C-x x r :: rename workspace

** Commenting

Commenting and uncommenting a line is mapped to =CMD-/= or =S-/=.

** Multiple select and edit

Here's the key-stroke to use the multiple select and edit feature.

- C-c C-SPC :: Select and edit leading edges
- C-c M-SPC :: Select and edit trailing edges

** GTD+Zettelkasten org-mode files
I created [[https://github.com/jjuliano/practical.org.el][practical.org.el]] GTD+Zettelkasten configuration and presets for
managing my tasks, notes, routines, habits and agenda. All the org files are
relative to your =org-directory= path. The plugin has pre-configured 4 org-files
by default which is included in the repository under the =files/= folder.

Please refer to the [[https://github.com/jjuliano/practical.org.el#installation][practical.org.el's installation instructions]].

Aside from the classic default keys. Here's important key-strokes for using the
=practical.org.el= presets.

** Further Customizations

Some packages are easy to include in the configuration, while other packages
requires post-installation procedures. In those packages, it's recommended to
use [[https://elpa.gnu.org/][GNU ELPA]] and [[https://melpa.org/][MELPA]].

The configuration contains the basic necessary settings for MELPA to readily use
it, which you can download the MELPA package and load those packages on startup.

Here's the most recommended packages to install, some are pre-configured.
